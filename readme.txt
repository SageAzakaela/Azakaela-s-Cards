Oh hi.

On the off chance you are here from one of my readings and don't understand what to do-- here's my quick guide.

At least this is how I run this code;

1. get Visual Studio Code
2. right click the folder with the file you want to run "Open with Code"
3. Select a Python Interpretor

-- This is where it gets tricky, if you're new to this -- you'll have to open up a terminal, and install all the imports so basically in your terminal-
-- type this crap
pip import tkinter
pip import random
pip import PIL

4. Now when you click on the python file you want to run: BY THE WAY:

- Which one you want to run?
-- I want just original cards, no flare or additional options -- You want "AzasDeckSimple"
-- I want more cards but don't need any options -- You want "AzasDeckExpanded"
-- "With Filters" has ... filters, it's kinda powerful or whatever to see the imagary you're after, but whatever, up to you.

(BACK TO 4) -- and make sure there are no "Problems" (to the left of the terminal) and resolve any errors there. it'll usually walk you through anythin
you may have fucced up like especially if you haven't set your PATH variables... which, honestly, if you have to do that, Look it up cuz I will not be able
to explain it very fuckin' well.

5. Now you can actually run the fucker, just right click, "Run in Terminal" and enjoy.
